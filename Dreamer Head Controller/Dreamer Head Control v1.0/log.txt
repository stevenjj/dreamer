Dreamer Head Control v1.0

This release combines the two previous programs, Dreamer Head Control v0.9 and
Random Motion Demo v1.0, into a single program. It also adds several new
features, particularly the use of small movements that fill the space between
larger movements.

The previous Dreamer Head Control (v0.9) was a quickly written remote control
program that was built as a modification of the Random Motion Demo v1.0. So
instead of maintaining both of those programs separately, we just combined them
into a single program. As it currently exists, Dreamer Head Control v1.0 runs
the random motion demo at startup and continuously forever, unless it receives a
command from a remote control PC. When it receives a remote command, it switches
to remote control mode and will not return to random demo mode until reset.

In future builds, we plan to make a more comprehensive serial interface that
allows a remote user to start or stop and program desired, as well as other
convenient settings.
