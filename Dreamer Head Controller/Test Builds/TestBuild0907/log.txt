Test Build 0906

This build replaces cosines.c/h, which was just a big precalculated array of predetermined size, with eightBitSine.c/h, which uses a quarter-wave lookup table to produce 8bit sine waves that are as accurate as any other 8bit calculation method but much faster.
If we have need in the future, we might write a 16-bit or 32-bit method that uses a larger lookup table or polynomials combined with interpolation. However, we don't expect to need that. Since we're working on a 32-bit system, doing multiple-then-divide scaling means we're limited to ~8bit resolution for our numerators to begin with. We don't expect this to be a problem.
