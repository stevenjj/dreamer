Test Build 0901

This build was created to finish the UART interpreter so the head's motion can be controlled remotely. It is based on v0.9 and most of the changes exist within the interpreter, though we also modified several lines of code in the motion planner and other functions that prevent the random motion planner from continuing on its own.
