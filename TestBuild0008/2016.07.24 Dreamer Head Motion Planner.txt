Blinking is random, independent from other actions
All other actions are built around gaze
Gaze utilizes three variable: pitch, yaw, and focal length

J00 (neck pitch)
    Neck pitch is function of focal length only. Neck leans forward as focal length increases.
J01 (head yaw)
    Head yaw = 2/3 of gaze yaw.
J02 (head roll)
    Head rolls ~= 1/3 gaze yaw. Head rolls left as head yaws right, and vice versa.
J03 (head pitch)
    Head pitch = 2/3 gaze pitch
J04 (eye pitch)
    Eye pitch = 1/3 gaze pitch
J05 (right eye yaw)
    Right eye yaw = 1/3 of gaze yaw.
J06 (left eye yaw)
    Left eye yaw = 1/3 of gaze yaw.
J07 (eyelid position)
    Eyelid position is function of focal length only. Eyelids close as focal length increases.



J0pos = atan((max_focus - min_focus)*random + min_focus);
J1pos = 2*gaze_yaw/3;
J2pos = -gaze_yaw/3;
J3pos = 2*gaze_pitch/3;
J4pos = gaze_pitch/3;
J5pos = gaze_yaw/3;
J6pos = gaze_yaw/3;
J7pos = atan()

focal length transformation: atan(pi*x/3 - 3)/pi + 0.4
