Dreamer Remote Controller

2016.09.28
   We've started work on remote control options for Dreamer's new head. The
first thing we're putting together is a very simple position controller that
allows the user to move the head to a variety of predetermined positions in
realtime. keyboardController.py reads the host PC's keyboard's arrow keys and
moves the head to any of four predetermined positions as the keys are pressed.
We've button mashed the keys and have not yet observed any dangerous behavior.
   This build is the first implementation of a haar cascade face detection
system for Dreamer. It is copied verbatim from a youtube channel. It works
pretty well, though it's fairly low performance and not very robust. It has a 
low framerate, its detection is very inconsistent, and it can't detect faces 
that aren't almost perfectly normal to the camera and almost perfectly upright. 
It's a lot better than nothing.
