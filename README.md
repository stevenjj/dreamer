# Dreamer Head Redesign, v57.0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're back to work on redesigning Dreamer's head. Hopefully this time we'll finish it. This project aims to run all twelve DOFs using the simplest possible combination of control hardware. Low cost would be nice. Most importantly, the final product needs to be reliable (a word never before applied to any part of Dreamer).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project uses TI TM4C Launchpad MCUs, Maxon ESCON motor drivers, the original Contelec Vert-X magnetic encoders, and custom PCBs. This will all easily fit into the original control systems space. All source code and circuit design documents can be found in this repository.
