Test Build 0001

2016.09.28
   This build is the first implementation of a haar cascade face detection
system for Dreamer. It is copied verbatim from a youtube channel. It works
pretty well, though it's fairly low performance and not very robust. It has a 
low framerate, its detection is very inconsistent, and it can't detect faces 
that aren't almost perfectly normal to the camera and almost perfectly upright. 
It's a lot better than nothing.
