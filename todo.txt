To Do

Software:
Include parity bits or other error checking in position command signals
Convert existing 0-255 joint space coordinates to something more useful
Complement existing sinusoidal interpolator lookup table with calculated sin values
Write linear interpolator, allow remote to choose which method is used for each command, or switch between as desired
Maybe something clever built around minimum jerk?
Startup handshake that allows PC to automatically find head
Combine all existing code into single class that lets us switch between control actions using keyboard and GUI
Include max velocities and accelerations in head code
Should we move gains and other user values to EEPROM so they can modified without recompiling head code?

Electronics:
Put microUSB and RJ-45 plugs on Dreamer back panel for head control and e-stop
Put optocoupler interface inside back panel so head controller is powered from torso but controlled from PC
debug light control
Set random motion demo as default, maybe starts running after a delay or if a button is pressed, ...
Create feedback side of interpreter, sends out status and position values either periodically or when polled
Fab PCBs to hold EC-32 flatflex cable connectors

Hardware:
Finish rebuilding ears and eyelids
